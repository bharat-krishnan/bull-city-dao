I scrutinize the underlying factors, such as the misappropriation of client funds and opaque operations that precipitated this downfall, compounded by a precipitous bank run following Binance's withdrawal. Furthermore, I explore the consequent ripples through the crypto sector, emphasizing the urgent call for regulatory clarity and the gravitation towards self-custody and decentralized mechanisms to fortify trust and security. This event, I argue, could herald a new era of stringent oversight, akin to the regulatory aftermath of the 2008 financial debacle, shaping the future trajectory of digital assets."

I dissect their operational mechanisms, highlighting the synergy between blockchain technology and these markets for creating transparent, decentralized, and accessible forecasting tools. Through examples, I illustrate how prediction markets surpass traditional forecasting methods in accuracy, fostering a more informed society. Moreover, I discuss the innovative concept of futarchies as a governance model, where speculative markets inform policy decisions, potentially revolutionizing democracy and organizational decision-making. Lastly, I address the challenges of regulation and the need for a nuanced approach to harness the full potential of prediction markets while mitigating risks."

                author = "William Zhao"
                about = "Delaying a financial transaction can be costly, but the cost of delay is difficult to estimate in traditional finance. I exploit the unique data offering and market design of the Ethereum blockchain to estimate the cost of delaying financial transactions in decentralized finance (DeFi). I construct a dynamic auction model for the Ethereum transaction fee market that relates users' optimal transaction fee bids to their delay cost functions and network conditions, and I structurally estimate the delay cost functions for different users and transaction types. The average cost of delaying a transaction by one minute is 8.78 US dollars, but the distribution of delay costs is highly skewed to the right. Delay costs are higher for complex transactions and users who trade more frequently. I estimate that welfare loss due to network delay on Ethereum was 14.03 million US dollars per day in July 2021, and I apply the delay cost estimates to evaluate the welfare losses under alternative transaction fee mechanisms."

Through digitizing physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, we unlock new opportunities for liquidity, democratize access to investment opportunities, and introduce a level of transparency and efficiency previously unattainable. Our presentation outlines the mechanisms, benefits, and challenges of tokenization, providing insights into its potential to reshape financial markets. We aim to equip stakeholders with the knowledge to navigate and leverage these emerging technologies for future growth."

                about = "The price-to-earnings or P/E ratio is an important index for valuing traditional financial sectors such as corporations and equities. P/E ratios are utilized by a variety of investors to analyze the value of a company's shares. This metric can also be highly useful for comparison against historical performance, can help to account for volatility over time, and has become commonly studied by value investors. The blockchain economy lacks an organized set of tools that can be used to inspect asset values. This proposal highlights the idea of employing a form of price-torevenue analysis on the Ethereum blockchain in order to generate a value assessment for the token Ether (ETH)."
